% Plots the distribution of data by hour and day. Gaps indicate no data.
% The colours indicate a Z-value: this can be considered a plot of a scalar
% field on 2d data which is designed to include data gaps.
%
% Input should be three equal length columns; x-values, y-values and the
% scalar value at that xy point.
%
% We use minimum and maximum xy value to create a mesh, then fill in the
% appropriate grid points to forma  matrix Z of the scalar values. THis is plotted as a surface and viewed from the top. 
%
% Currently it expects dates on the x-axis
